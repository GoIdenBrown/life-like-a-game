# What?

Life like a game!

Sometimes we really want to start running in the morning or keep a record of our spending, but somehow it doesnâ€™t work out. This application is created in order to turn life into a game!

1. Module "Hobby"
    
    The idea of â€‹â€‹the module is to develop a hobby by recording daily progress in the application. The application will lead a streak, as well as encourage if you have reached N number of days in a row.
    
    Reference - Duolingo
    
2. Module "Investment" 
    
    The idea of â€‹â€‹the module is to keep records of your income and expenses. The application will calculate how much you have spent on a particular expense item, how much you have accumulated, and so on.
    
3. Module "Quest"
    
    The idea of â€‹â€‹the module is to turn your everyday activities, whether it's going to the store or washing windows, into quests. A reward is formed for each case, so you clearly see what you will get and what characteristics of your character will increase
    
    Reference - RPG games
    
4. Module "Statistics"
    
    The whole essence of the application is to make life like a game, and what game is without statistics?! This module is essentially the final part of the application, which will aggregate all the other moments in itself and show statistics on your character
